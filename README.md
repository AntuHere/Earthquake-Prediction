# Earthquake-Prediction
# Global Earthquake Analysis & Magnitude Prediction System 🌍🔍

## Overview
This project leverages **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Geospatial Analysis** to process and visualize **real-time earthquake data** from **USGS (United States Geological Survey)**. The system performs comprehensive analysis, creates interactive visualizations, and predicts earthquake magnitudes using two powerful machine learning models: **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression**.

Key Features:
- **Interactive Folium Web Map** of global earthquake activity in the last 30 days.
- **Heatmap** of earthquake concentrations around the world.
- **Statistical Analysis** of earthquake magnitudes and distribution.
- **Earthquake Magnitude Prediction** using:
  - Linear Regression (R² = 78%)
  - Random Forest Regression (R² = 98%)

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the earthquake data files (either fetched from the USGS API or processed data).
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **src**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
- **visualizations**: Scripts for generating interactive maps and plots.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the project.
